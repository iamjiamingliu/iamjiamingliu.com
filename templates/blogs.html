                        My projects show the builder side. My leadership roles show the leader side.
                        This blog is my attempt at showing the thinker side.

                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                        “Thinker” might be too grand. At its core, this is a collection of deeper-than-resume
                        narratives:
                        the journey and architecture behind my projects and endeavors, plus some thoughts on tech,
                        and on my world view.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                        I write concisely and informally. Curse words are used strategically to emphasize.
                        You may notice that many of the things described in my blogs are events that happened at least a year ago,
                        and that's intentional: I cannot write ongoing things due to their volatile nature,
                        and also because I haven't had time to think about them yet.
                    </p>

                        有时候用中文写点，我文笔不咋地，毕竟我中文只是小学文凭。凑活看吧哈哈
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                        I want to especially highlight the "World View" section of my blogs.
                        Yes, I am a tech guy, so you'd imagine I only talk about tech and is probably quite insensitive to the rest of the real world.
                        But, from my unexplained penchant to devour BBC, DWW, 60 minutes documentaries; 柴静; biographies; history; and BBC nature,
                        I guess I have devoured a pretty strong and sentimental view toward the greater society and world.
                        And I would love to share them here.
                        I have plenty of close friends to confide my passion for technology to,
                        but folks around me don't watch documentaries or read books as much so the following blog is the only channel I can make a voice.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                        你挑几篇读一下。你可以说，我忧国忧民，杞人忧天，瞎操功夫。你也可以说，此儿其实素有大义耶。看你怎么看啦~ 我任你评说
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                        Oh, why do I bother to spend all the time writing on this stuff?
                        To flex my knowledge on you? Sure, and I'm not ashamed of flexing my knowledge because it's the cumulative result of hard honest thinking and doing.
                        To share helpful knowledge and insights with you?
                        Yes absolutely. If you are in college or hasn't started working for too long, my technical blogs will be helpful to you for sure.
                        If you are an experienced engineer, then my technical blogs can still be a cool read,
                        as they may be thin in terms of pure technical information gain relative to your experience,
                        but rich nevertheless in terms of insights and thinking and might give you "oh, you can think about it that way too".
                        But I believe the Worldview section of my blog will make a difference no matter who you are...
                        Because everyone views the world differently, surely they can give you some extent of eye freshening stuff.
                        Some of what I say might be common sense, some might be things you don't notice usually, some might be things you disagree with.
                        But as I said, that's my world view, and everyone's world view is different.
