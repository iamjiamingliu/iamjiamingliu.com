                        On the homepage of iamjiamingliu.com, I call myself a
                        <span class="fw-semibold text-dark">builder</span>,
                        <span class="fw-semibold text-dark">leader</span>, and

                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                        My projects show the builder side. My leadership roles show the leader side.
                        This blog is my attempt at showing my thinker side.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                        “Thinker” is a grand word. But simply, this is a collection of deeper-than-resume
                        narratives:
                        the journey and architecture behind my projects and endeavors, plus some thoughts on tech,
                        and on my world view.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                        I write concisely and informally. Curse words are used strategically to emphasize.
                        You may notice that many of the things described in my blogs are events that happened at least a year ago,
                        and that's intentional: I cannot write ongoing things due to their volatile nature,
                        and also because I haven't had time to think about them yet.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                        有时候用中文写点，我文笔不咋地，毕竟我中文只是小学文凭。凑活看吧哈哈
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                        I want to especially highlight the "World View" section of my blogs.
                        Yes, I am a tech guy, so you'd imagine I only talk about tech and is quite insensitive to the rest of the real world.
                        But, from my unexplained penchant to devour BBC, DWW, 60 minutes documentaries; 柴静; biographies; history; and BBC nature,
                        I guess I have developed a pretty strong and sentimental view on the greater society and world we live in.
                        I have plenty of close friends to confide my passion for technology to,
                        but folks around me don't watch documentaries or read books as much,
                        so blogging here is the only channel I can make my voice heard.

                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                        你挑几篇读一下。你可以说，我忧国忧民，杞人忧天，瞎操功夫。你也可以说，此儿其实素有大义耶。看你怎么看啦~ 我任你评说
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                        By the way, I greatly resent LinkedIn guru style posts or ChatGPT generated generic stuff.
                        Thus, my writings use concrete examples and claims when applicable to avoid being cliché and corny.
                    </p>


                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                        I hope no matter where you are in tech, whether as a college kid or experienced professional,
                        my writing can offer some helpful insights.
                        And I welcome your comments and thoughts!
